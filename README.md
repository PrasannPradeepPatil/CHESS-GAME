### Project overview

- The game is played with pawns placed on the 2nd row from each player
- Spots held by player 'b' will have a "'b'", and likewise player 'w' will have "'w'"
- Player 'w' moves first
- Pawns can move forward one space to an empty location, or diagonally one space to capture an opponent’s pawn at that location.
- A player must capture an opponent’s pawn if a capturing move is available.
- On any capturing move, the player immediately moves again with another pawn that has not yet moved that turn.
- The first player to get a pawn to the opposite end of the board wins, unless a player is left without any move, in which case the   other player immediately wins.
