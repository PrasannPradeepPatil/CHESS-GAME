# EverChess-challenge

A simple, command line chess-like game.

## Background

- The game is played with pawns placed on the 2nd row from each player
- Spots held by player 1 will have a "1", and likewise player 2 will have "2"
- Player 2 moves first
- Pawns can move forward one space to an empty location, or diagonally one space to capture an
opponent’s pawn at that location.
- A player must capture an opponent’s pawn if a capturing move is available.
- On any capturing move, the player immediately moves again with another pawn that has not yet moved
that turn.
- The first player to get a pawn to the opposite end of the board wins, unless a player is left without any
move, in which case the other player immediately wins.
